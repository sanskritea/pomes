Speeding through the dusty dark<br>
As gases and galaxies hurried past<br>
She chanced upon a burning star.<br>

A solitary giant burning bright:<br>
Outlandish to think theyâ€™d collide<br>
With barely crossing worldlines.<br>

They remained in orbit for epochs,  <br> 
Content to sometimes flare or look<br>
Circling the sky till their cores shook.<br>

Spiral bones of their supernovae<br>
Spread across space, when we see<br>
Their courses altered infinitesimally.<br>

Across scores of light years they flew<br>
Cooling, contracting, pulsing too,<br>
Along paths that slowly inched close.<br>

Ripples in spacetime later, he found<br>
Her falling to him and going around:<br>
Bound together, as gravity pronounced.<br>

As one they swim the cosmic ocean<br>
Each turn of the tide pulling them in,<br>
And thus their final inspiral begins.<br>

The parsecs go by, Time is delayed,<br>
Their merger approaches, they wait <br>
With bated breath, to seal their fate.<br>
<br>
*Though densely cold, this twin binary burning*<br>
*Are equals in form, and will unite in the abyss;*<br>
*While the Sun watches his lady wane and wax* <br>
*Poetic: the two unbalanced, apart and yearning.*<br>
