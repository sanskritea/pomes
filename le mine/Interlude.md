After what seems like an eternity, they break apart, gasping for air-<br>
<br>
*A momentary calm for the storm to abate<br>
A tiny space of seconds in which to breathe,<br>
rest their racing hearts, as desire retreats.*<br>

*Smell the scent slowly steaming off the neck,<br>
Let grasping hands drift, seek silent moans<br>
disguised as sighs, soft hums, low groans.*<br>

*It is but a pause, before business resumes.<br>
Let the lips taste wind and eyes see gold:<br>
the ascending crescendo waiting to unfold.*<br>

*Steady shivering knees, find new footing,<br>
Look around again, ensure coast stays clear<br>
Ask assent, brace self, once more draw near:*<br>
<br>
-a minute later, and they are (lips, tongues, arms) entwined again.
