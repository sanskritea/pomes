After what seems like an eternity, they break apart, gasping for air-

A momentary calm for the storm to abate
A tiny space of seconds in which to breathe,
rest their racing hearts, as desire retreats.

Smell the scent slowly steaming off the neck,
Let grasping hands drift, seek silent moans
disguised as sighs, soft hums, low groans.

It is but a pause, before business resumes.
Let the lips taste wind and eyes see gold:
the ascending crescendo waiting to unfold.

Steady shivering knees, find new footing,
Look around again, ensure coast stays clear
Ask assent, brace self, once more draw near:

- a minute later, and they are (lips, tongues, arms) entwined again.
