*Betwixt a promise and a lie<br>
We lay suspended<br>
		-you and I.*<br>
<br>
There is that which I do not say,<br>
But would much rather spit out.<br>
The silly songbird’s flown its cage<br>
T’would do well to stay without.<br>
<br>
Without a word to give or keep<br>
There seems to be a small hollow:<br>
In this quiet heart forgot to weep<br>
The lake of tears has run shallow.<br>
<br>
I wish to sing those silly songs<br>
And find again a golden pen;<br>
But I know the left from wrong<br>
And wipe away the looming rain.<br>
<br><br>
To let go and spill the words within<br>
And hope that wind catches me<br>
If I say that which I know I mustn’t<br>
Would whatever will be, still be?<br>
