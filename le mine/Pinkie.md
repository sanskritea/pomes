Betwixt a promise and a lie
We lay suspended
		-you and I.

There is that which I do not say,
But would much rather spit out.
The silly songbird’s flown its cage
T’would do well to stay without.

Without a word to give or keep
There seems to be a small hollow:
In this quiet heart forgot to weep
The lake of tears has run shallow.

I wish to sing those silly songs
And find again a golden pen;
But I know the left from wrong
And wipe away the looming rain.

To let go and spill the words within 
And hope that wind catches me
If I say that which I know I mustn’t 
Would whatever will be, still be?
