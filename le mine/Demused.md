My Muse is locked inside his room:
seeing not sun nor midnight moon

My Muse is moody and apt to brood:
responds not to babe, or bro or dude

My Muse is eating less than enough:
skipping meals, saying cookingâ€™s tough 

My Muse is heavy-eyed yet sleepless:
stargazing with immoderate success

My Muse is far away and lonesome:
has spent months waiting to return

My Muse is silent most of the time:
how on Earth am I going to write?
