My Muse is locked inside his room:<br>
seeing not sun nor midnight moon<br>

My Muse is moody and apt to brood:<br>
responds not to babe, or bro or dude<br>

My Muse is eating less than enough:<br>
skipping meals, saying cookingâ€™s tough <br>

My Muse is heavy-eyed yet sleepless:<br>
stargazing with immoderate success<br>

My Muse is far away and lonesome:<br>
has spent months waiting to return<br>

My Muse is silent most of the time:<br>
how on Earth am I going to write?<br>
